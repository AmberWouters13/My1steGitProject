# My 1ste Git Project

**Dictionary of Concepts**

Git: Software managing/ track changes

GitHub:

Conceptual areas: 

- Dev area: folder where i develop my project 

- Staging area: ogranize, to prepare, intermediate area to organize and to plan and commit

- local repository: Save your timeline

To collaborate you first need to get an invite (GitHub). Afterwards, your collaborator should clone the repository with ``git clone``. **Don't do this in a folder that is already a git repo!** Then you can modify files in that project and follow the usual routine: 

```git
git status

git add <file>

git commit -m "Add short description about collaborating"

git push
```
